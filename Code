What I did
- Created a single .dax file containing a reusable measure set and seven queries that produce common breakdowns: daily, monthly (via Date table), by route, by driver, combined date/route/driver, top N drivers, and absolute total.
- Included helper measures: average per trip and percent-of-total to surface useful KPIs alongside totals.

How to import / run
- DAX Studio (recommended for ad-hoc queries):
  1. Open DAX Studio and connect to your Power BI Desktop file or SSAS model.
  2. File → Open → select this .dax file.
  3. Place cursor on the EVALUATE statement you want and press Run (or select the block and run).
- Power BI Desktop (to add persistent measures):
  1. In Power BI Desktop, go to Modeling → New measure.
  2. Copy each measure expression (the right-hand side only) from the DEFINE block and create the corresponding measure in your model.
  3. Build visuals using those measures and the provided group-by columns.
