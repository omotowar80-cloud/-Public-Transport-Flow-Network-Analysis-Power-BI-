Total Passenger
12345
(12345 is the sum of Passengers On across the Actual Trips rows visible in the current filter context.)

Important notes and gotchas

SUM requires Passengers On to be numeric. Non-numeric values will cause errors.
SUM ignores blank values (they are not counted).
SUMMARIZECOLUMNS without group columns returns exactly one row. If you intended to break down totals (by date, route, etc.) you must pass grouping columns to SUMMARIZECOLUMNS.
SUMMARIZECOLUMNS respects the current external filter context. If you want the absolute total regardless of filters, wrap the measure in CALCULATE(..., ALL('Actual Trips')).
Defining measures inline with DEFINE is fine for ad-hoc queries (DAX Studio, SSAS/Tomato), but to persist the measure you should create it in the model.
Alternatives / examples

If you want the total ignoring filters: DEFINE MEASURE 'Actual Trips'[Total Passenger] = CALCULATE(SUM('Actual Trips'[Passengers On]), ALL('Actual Trips')) EVALUATE SUMMARIZECOLUMNS("Total Passenger", [Total Passenger])

If you want totals per route: DEFINE MEASURE 'Actual Trips'[Total Passenger] = SUM('Actual Trips'[Passengers On]) EVALUATE SUMMARIZECOLUMNS( 'Actual Trips'[Route], "Total Passenger", [Total Passenger] )

As a minimal single scalar row using ROW (if you just want a one-row result): DEFINE MEASURE 'Actual Trips'[Total Passenger] = SUM('Actual Trips'[Passengers On]) EVALUATE ROW("Total Passenger", [Total Passenger])

Performance tip

SUM is efficient. If you add many grouping columns or compute expensive expressions per row, consider pre-aggregating or limiting the rowset.
